A simple whiteboard with grids written in just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a great tool for occasional brainstorming/explanation process. It is also the first of the four milestones for Ardent Academy's internship.

## Versioning
I only used Git bash as the sole version management method.

I want to say thank you to my fellow interns in Ardent Academy for their assistance. Also, kudos to Dr. Li for providing this amazing opportunity to let me work in Ardent.
